  <h3>About ADAGE</h3>
</div>

<p>
  The <strong>ADAGE</strong> (<strong>A</strong>nalysis using
  <strong>D</strong>enoising <strong>A</strong>utoencoders of
  <strong>G</strong>ene <strong>E</strong>xpression) web server allows users
  without programming expertise to analyze signatures extracted from large
  compendia of gene expression data via unsupervised machine learning methods.
  We primarily designed the server to support models constructed by
  <a href="http://msystems.asm.org/content/1/1/e00025-15">ADAGE</a>
  and
  <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/10/078659">eADAGE</a>;
  however, the server was designed to be general and can be used for other
  types of machine learning models as well. Signatures from PCA, ICA, NMF, and
  other factorization methods can also be loaded into the server.
