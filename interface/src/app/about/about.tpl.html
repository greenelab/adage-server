<p class="h4">
  The <strong>ADAGE</strong> (<strong>A</strong>nalysis using
  <strong>D</strong>enoising <strong>A</strong>utoencoders of
  <strong>G</strong>ene <strong>E</strong>xpression) web server allows users
  without programming expertise to analyze signatures extracted from large
  compendia of gene expression data via unsupervised machine learning methods.
  We primarily designed the server to support models constructed by
  <a href="http://msystems.asm.org/content/1/1/e00025-15">ADAGE</a>
  and
  <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/10/078659">eADAGE</a>;
  however, the server was designed to be general and can be used for other
  types of machine learning models as well.

  If you use the server for any type of model, please cite the

  you use.
